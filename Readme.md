## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Git


aosp-view needs the `git` executable to be installed on the system and available
in your `PATH` for most operations.
If it is not in your `PATH`, you can set it after start.


## Install & Run

Download the source code and run:
```shell
python main.py
```

Perhaps build executables in the future
